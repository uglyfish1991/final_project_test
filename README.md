# Coffee Shop Dashboard Project

## Practise Project

---

The aim of the project is to create a Flask app which allows users to enter certain sales figures, and have some mathemtatical statistics generated (mean, etc.) These figures will be added to a database.

The app will also allow users to download this data as an excel file.

Other functionalility I am looking to include:
1. CRUD operations on rows
2. Ability to generate matplotlib chart of a week's worth of sales figures.
3. Ability to choose graph paramters (show mean, show daily sales, show drinks sold etc)
